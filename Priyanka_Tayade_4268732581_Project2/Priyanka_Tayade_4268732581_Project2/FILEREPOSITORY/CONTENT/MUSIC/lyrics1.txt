A LAND WHERE ALL ARE LIKE SHEEP IN THE FLOCK
WHERE EVERYONE THINKS ALIKE, WHERE NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY THOUGHT
WHERE NO ONE CARES TO INSPECT WHAT IS REALLY WRONG

A LAND WHERE MAJORITY NOTION IS TAKEN FOR AXIOM
WHERE THERE IS CONFUSION OF EVEN WHAT IS RIGHT OR WRONG
WHERE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WAS THE SEED FOR EVERY WAR

A LAND WHERE NO ONE KNOWS FROM WHERE THEY ARRIVE
WHERE NEITHER DO THEY HAVE ANY CLUE WHAT IS LEFT AFTER THEY DIE
STILL WHERE EVERYONE HAS THEIR INHERITANCE PRIDE

A LAND RULED BY PERCEPTION WHERE REALITY IS DISTORTED
WHERE GOOD IS QUESTION OR TAKEN FOR GRANTED
WHERE BAD IS TEMPTING AND PEOPLE ARE EASILY FOOLED

A LAND WHERE ALL FOLLOW THEIR DAILY TASK
WHERE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IS ACCEPTED AND UNIVERSE REMAINS DARK
WHERE REASON FOR THEIR UN-SATISFACTION, NO ONE SEEMS TO FIND OR ASK

A LAND WHERE I HAVE SEEN EVERY NOOK AND CORNER
WHERE NEVER FINDING IN MY IGNORANCE, ENDLESSLY I WANDER
WHERE TIRED, I STRIVE TO FIND THE DOOR TO STOP RUNNING FOREVER
