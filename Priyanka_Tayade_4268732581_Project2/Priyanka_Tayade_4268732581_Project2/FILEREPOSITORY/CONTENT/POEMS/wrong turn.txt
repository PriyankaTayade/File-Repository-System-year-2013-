wrong turn on the road.
Author Priyanka Tayade

As usual walking the road
I was to start a day full of load

But life took its unusual turn
I met you under the morning sun

You were looking good and stern
I was left surprise in turn

I thought there was some spark in our conversation 
you asked me your query during this session

you left the place finding your solution
and I was left waiting for some consideration

In all this episode I lost track of time
I noticed my watch it was nine!

Now I am late accompanied with all the previous load
 I think I took a wrong turn on the road!
